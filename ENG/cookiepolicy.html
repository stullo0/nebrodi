<li> Location information: We can determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. </li> 
<li> Information from cookies and other technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
